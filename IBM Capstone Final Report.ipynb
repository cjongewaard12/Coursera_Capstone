The categories included in the analysis are median housing price, school ratings, crime rates, infrastructure, weather conditions, emergency services, water resources, public health, and recreational facilities.\n\n This will help make an informed decision of the area or neighborhood before moving to a new city, state, country or place for their work.\n\nThe problem I am trying to solve is finding the best neighborhood or a list of the top neighborhoods for people moving to Canada or looking to relocate within Canada. This will be based upon the factors listed above."

Foursquare is a location data provider with information about all of the categories needed to the analysis. Such information includes venue names, locations, menus and even photos. Therefore the foursquare location platform will be used as the only data source since all of the data can be attained through the API.\n\nAfter finding the list of neighborhoods, we then connect to the Foursquare API to gather information about venues inside each and every neighborhood. For each neighborhood, we have chosen the radius to be 100 meter.\nThe data retrieved from Foursquare contained information of venues within a specified distance of the longitude and latitude of the postcodes. The information obtained per venue as follows:\n\n1. Neighborhood \n2. Neighborhood Latitude \n3. Neighborhood Longitude \n4. Venue \n5. Name of the venue e.g. the name of a store or restaurant \n6. Venue Latitude \n7. Venue Longitude \n8. Venue Category "

The next step is to segment the neighborhoods and group them into appropriate clusters based off of the categories listed above and data gathered later on using foursquare. Grouping them into clusters allows me to mine the data and find similar neighborhoods in a fairly large city. This approach ensures more accuracy as well. To execute this strategy properly I had to use k-means clustering algorithm which is an unpserpisved form of machine learning."

However it should be noted that immigration is an important topic within the political arena with more governments seeking more restrictions on immigrants and refugees. Yet, the general trend of immigration into Canada has been one of on the rise which makes Scarborough even more appealing, especially for its American counterparts."

This is based off of the one hundred and three different lattitude and logitude locations within the dataset. These coordinates are fairly similar with the only differences in the categories laid out in the introduction. Further based off of the charts presented above the median housing price and school ratings points to Scarborough again being the top of neighborhoods being analyzed with Malvern, Rouge, Union Station, and Toronto Islnds occupying a good balance between school ratings and median price. Obvioulsy there are neighborhoods with higher school ratings or higher median price, but the best neighborhood would provide a lower median price and higher school rating. Overall it seems like there is not a clear winner. However, this is only based on two categories. \n\nOverall this project has shown a practical application of the topics covered in the IBM data science courses. This application was then used to resolve a real world situation that impacts personal and financial situations of actual famalies."

A more extensive and in-depth analysis is usually better and should include daily needs or things we need to live a better life. There are many approaches that could be taken in furture projects."
